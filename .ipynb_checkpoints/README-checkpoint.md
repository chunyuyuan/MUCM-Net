# MUCM-Net

This is the official network impletation code repository for "MUCM-Net: A Mamba Powered UCM-Net for Skin Lesion Segmentation " It is accepted by Exploration of Medicine, https://www.explorationpub.com/Journals/em

**Prepare the dataset.**

- The ISIC2017 and ISIC2018 datasets,which follows the same as UltraLight-VM-UNet , can be found here {[One Drive]}. 
- {[ISIC2017]()}
- {[ISIC2018]()}
-  (PS: you can use above link to directly download the dataset and put them in the data folder or use UltraLight-VM-UNet code to generate the division of dataset)


**Train the MUCM-Net.**
```
The training file will be posted later. Some setting files are the same as UCM-NetV2. You can refer it "https://github.com/chunyuyuan/UCMV2-Net"
